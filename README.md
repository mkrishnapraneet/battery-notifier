# battery notifier

Battery Notifier : An application to notify you when your laptop battery level is out of the optimum range (that you can set), for example 40%-80% (default). Using this application, you can maintain your laptop battery levels optimally, and thus prolong your laptop's battery life. I have here versions of the same application for both Windows and Linux.
