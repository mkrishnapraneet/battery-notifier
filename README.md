Just me trying out and building various small apps/programs while learning. Some of the work I've done till now : 
1. Battery Notifier : An application to notify you when your laptop battery level is out of the optimum range (that you can set), for example 40%-80%. Using this application, you can maintain your laptop battery levels optimally, and thus prolong your laptop's battery life. I have here versions of the same application for both Windows and Linux.
